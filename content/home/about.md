# Biography

I am an assistant professor in the [Computer Science Department](https://computerscience.missouristate.edu/) at [Missouri State University](http://www.missouristate.edu/). My research focus is on developing small, autonomous robots. Specifically, I optimize such systems for better performance (how quickly can they move around) and efficiency (how long can they run on a single battery charge).
